### General tools and equipment
- 3D printer

    All components of this project were printed on a home-built [Makerfarm](www.makerfarm.com) Prusa 8" i3v.  Presumably, a commercial printer will provide comparable (or more likely, superior) print quality.
- Filament
    
    Builds were tested with PLA (eSun) and PETG (Gizmodorks).  The latter is preferred due to its increased chemical resistance relative to PLA and the structural performance (it is less brittle).


- M3 hex key and wrench
- Exacto knife
- Sandpaper
- Adjustable wrench
- Needle nosed pliers
- Helping hand with magnifier or dissecting microscope 




### syringe pump
- 1/4" steel rod, 150 mm length, (1)
- 1/4"-20 TPI threaded steel rod, 170 mm length (1)
- 5V DC small reduction stepper motor from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/858).
- M3x10 hex-bolts (10)
- M3 hex nuts
- M3x20 hex bolts (3)
- 1/4" 20 TPI nuts (4)
- 1/4" 20 TPI jamnuts (4)
- Syringes

    The default configuration uses a 3-mL HSW luer slip eccentric syringe which can be found at [Restek](http://www.restek.com/catalog/view/8027) although I purchased my batch from Fisher Scientific (and they apprently no longer sell them).  A different syringe can be used by adjusting the parameters in the global file.


### fluidics system
- silicone tubing (Cole Parmer) 
- quick-setting epoxy
