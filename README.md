## Open Millifluidic Inquiry System ##

![The Thingiverse version](http://thingiverse-production-new.s3.amazonaws.com/renders/82/5c/66/e7/8c/cab0c1632ac344750e0b66e4ed6dca2e_preview_featured.jpg)

The **Open Millifluidic Inquiry System** (OMIS) is a platform for lab-on-a-chip technologies and miniaturized analysis systems. It is a 3D printed, Arduino-based science and engineering project that allows the end-user (student/teacher/hobbyist) to explore the science of fluids. OMIS currently has two parts. The first is a syringe pump constructed from 3D printed parts, an inexpensive stepper motor and some items from the local hardware store. The second part is a “millifluidic device” which is also 3D printed. OMIS is designed with learning and inquiry in mind, and all elements of the design have been created to encourage exploration.

## Quick start
1. Print the parts located in the STL directory.
2. Purchase the items in the [Bill of Materials](documentation/BOM.md).
3. Follow the [build guide](documentation/BuildGuide.md).
4. Design your circuit using [this Adafruit guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-16-stepper-motors/parts?view=all).
5. Upload the sketch in the software directory to your Arduino.

## Resources
- [The github](http://www.github.com/bobthechemist/omis) repository will be used for version management and issue tracking.  This will be true for design files, software and lessons/activities.
- My [personal webpage](http://www.bobthechemist.com/omis) will be the source for commentary and any opinions I have on the project.
- The build at [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1646999) will remain as the original version for historical reasons.
